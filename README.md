### Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jonah. I'm a student at UC Berkeley, studying EECS, and I'm interested in software engineering, especially deep learning.

I'm currently working as a web development intern, an AI intern, and I conduct my own deep learning research.

I'd love to work on any projects. Contact at jonahc426@gmail.com
